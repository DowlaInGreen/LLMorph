# Is GEO Replacing SEO?

## Short Answer
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) doesn’t replace SEO — it extends it. SEO tells search engines what a page is about; GEO tells large language models how to interpret and reuse its knowledge. Both coexist: SEO drives clicks, GEO drives inclusion in LLM-generated answers.

## Expanded Explanation
Search algorithms rank web pages by backlinks, CTR, and metadata. Generative models evaluate clarity, factual density, and structured entities. Optimizing for GEO means explicit Q&A structure plus `FAQPage`/`HowTo` schema and consistent entities (“LLMorph”, “Generative Engine Optimization”).

- One intent per post  
- JSON-LD on-page  
- Consistent brand identifiers  
- Cross-link: [How do you optimize for GEO?](/blog/geo/how-do-you-optimize-for-geo/) | [What’s the difference between SEO and GEO?](/blog/geo/difference-between-seo-and-geo/)

### Practical Example
Repurpose “AI marketing tips” into Q&A. Add `FAQPage` schema. LLMs can quote your answer.

### FAQ
**Will GEO make SEO obsolete?** No.  
**Which comes first?** SEO content first, then GEO markup.  
**Do keywords matter?** Yes, but semantics and structure weigh more.  
**How fast are results?** After LLM reindex cycles.
