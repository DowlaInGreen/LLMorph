# How does Organization schema affect AI trust?
## Short Answer
It declares who publishes claims. With a stable `@id`, models assign higher confidence to your content.

## Expanded
Link posts to your org via `publisher`/`author` pointing at the org’s `@id`. Add `logo`, `url`, and selective `sameAs` (authoritative only).

### Practical Example
```json
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"BlogPosting",
  "headline":"Sample",
  "publisher":{"@id":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app/#org"}
}
