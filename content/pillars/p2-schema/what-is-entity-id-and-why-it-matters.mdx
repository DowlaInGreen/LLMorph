# What is an entity ID and why is it vital for AI memory?
## Short Answer
An `@id` is a stable, absolute URL that defines an entity’s identity. It lets models merge facts without confusion.

## Expanded
Use one `@id` per entity (e.g., `https://ll-morph.vercel.app/#org`). Reuse it across pages to connect claims and reduce ambiguity for both search engines and LLMs.

### Practical Example
```json
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"Organization",
  "@id":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app/#org",
  "name":"LLMorph",
  "url":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app"

What is an entity ID and why is it vital for AI memory?

Short Answer

An @id is a stable, absolute URL that defines an entity’s identity. It lets models merge facts without confusion.

Expanded

Use one @id per entity (e.g., https://yourdomain/#org). Reuse it across pages to connect claims and reduce ambiguity for both search engines and LLMs.

Practical Example
{
  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"Organization",
  "@id":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app/#org",
  "name":"LLMorph",
  "url":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app"
}
FAQ

Do I need sameAs? Add 2–5 authoritative profiles; avoid weak directories.
Should @id resolve? It can, but doesn’t have to. It must be a stable, absolute URL.
