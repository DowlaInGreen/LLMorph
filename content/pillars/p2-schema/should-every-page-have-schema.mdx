# Should every page have schema?
## Short Answer
Identity schema (Organization, Person) should be universal. Content-specific schema only where relevant.

## Expanded
Over-markup creates noise. Apply the right type per intent; reuse a stable `@id` instead of duplicating data.

### Practical Example
```json
{"@context":"https://schema.org","@graph":[
  {"@type":"Organization","@id":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app/#org","name":"LLMorph"},
  {"@type":"WebPage","name":"Services","url":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app/services"}
]}
