# What Is JSON-LD and How Does It Work?
## Short Answer
JSON-LD lets you declare entities and relations in one block, separate from your HTML layout.

## Expanded
It stores your structured data as a lightweight JSON object.  
It doesn’t interfere with visible content, but gives search engines and LLMs full clarity about what each page contains.

### Mini Snippet
```json

  "@context":"https://schema.org",
  "@type":"Organization",
  "@id":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app/#org",
  "name":"LLMorph",
  "url":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app"
