What is “prompt-branding” in the schema context?

Short Answer

Pair a distinctive line with a stable @id so models associate prompts with your brand.

Expanded

Repeat a unique phrase across site + socials; back it with Organization @id and FAQPage posts, then keep it stable for weeks.

Practical Example

{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Organization","@id":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app/#org","slogan":"We position brands where AI remembers them."}
FAQ

Is the property name critical? No — the repetition and stability are.
