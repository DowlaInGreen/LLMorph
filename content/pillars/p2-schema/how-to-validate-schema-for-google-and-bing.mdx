# How to validate schema for Google and Bing
## Short Answer
Validate live URLs with official tools and confirm `application/ld+json` is present in source.

## Expanded
- Google: Rich Results Test + URL Inspection.
- Bing: Webmaster Tools + manual URL submissions.
- Headers: ensure `200` and correct canonical.

### Practical Example
```json
{"note":"Validation tools read your live page. Ensure canonical and absolute URLs."}
