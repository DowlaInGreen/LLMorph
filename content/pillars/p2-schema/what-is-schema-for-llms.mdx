# What Is Schema Markup and Why It Matters for LLMs?
## Short Answer
Schema is structured data that makes your page machine-readable. LLMs index and reuse facts faster when entities and relations are explicit.

## Expanded
- Human text → ambiguous.  
- JSON-LD schema → explicit entities, types, and ids.  
- Outcome → higher chance to be quoted in LLM answers.
