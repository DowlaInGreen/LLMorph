# Which schema types improve LLM visibility most?
## Short Answer
Prioritize Organization, Person, FAQPage, HowTo, BlogPosting, and BreadcrumbList. They establish identity, intent, and relationships.

## Expanded
- **Organization/Person** → who you are.
- **FAQPage/HowTo** → question–answer and step intent.
- **BlogPosting/Article** → topical authority tied to your org.
- **BreadcrumbList** → hierarchy and cluster context.

### Practical Example
```json
{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Organization","@id":"https://ll-morph.vercel.app/#org","name":"LLMorph"}
